# Exquisite Corpse

Necromancy!

## Okay, not really necromancy

Exquisite Corpse was a (probaby pretentious) game invented by surrealists as a fun diversion, and probably an appropriate activity for drinking absinthe until the sun came up.

The game is played by writing a sentence or two on a piece of paper, then concealing all but the last few words and handing to paper to someone else. Once everyone has contributed, the full composition is revealed, to the delight of everyone present.

There's also a drawing version of the game, but that's not important right now.

This app attempts to recreate the game without the benefits of pen, paper, or proximity. It's a project I first created way back in 2017, when I was graduating for an intensive 12-week code school. I know a lot more now, and also there is a ton of new tech.

Let's see what I can do!

## Other stuff

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

-   [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
